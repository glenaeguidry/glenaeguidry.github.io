<h1><b>Hello, World</b>! </h1>
<p>My name is Glenae' Guidry. <br>
I am a Sophomore at Dillard University. <br>
This website is all about me and the things I love.<br></p>

<p>I was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana.<br>

I love being from New Orleans because there is no city like it.</p>

<p>Chris Brown's clothing line is called Black Pyramid, and it has became one of my favorite clothing lines from any artist. <br>
